# C64-project-mutiny

bit of fun coding, 

assembly is hard ;)

yes, code seems loose and it is.
I needed to experience how much
fun coding would still bring me now.

1st comes coding and understanding.
Optimizing and stripping cycles
comes later but not in this process 

load in your favourite emulator or
original hardware to start:
