# C64-project-mutiny

bit of fun coding learning how to..

assembly is hard :)

yes, code seems loose and it is.
I needed to experience how much
fun coding would bring me now.

1st comes coding and understanding
optimizing and stripping cycles
comes later but not in this process 

I have some thoughts/ideas about 
doing a community game project,
as a huge fan of jRPG creating such
a game on Mega65/C64 would be absolutely
awesome! 

It also would create a great opportunity
to learn for some less experienced coders
as myself and great tutoring role for the
, undoubtedly, great group of guru's in
this community.

I like to share those thoughts in the
coming days and see if there is interest
and a feeling of 'yeah! let's kick start
this new wonderful piece of 8 bit tech with
a standard setting  community effort!
